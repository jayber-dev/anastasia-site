          Data management tools such as CRM and ERP are essential for managing
          customer,<br />
          financial, and other business data. Approximately 90% of organizations
          with 11 or more employees use a CRM, which explains why the ERP market
          is expected to exceed $49.5 billion in just a few years. To make the
          most of both platforms and ensure that your most critical business
          processes function effectively, you must integrate them.
        </p>

          The purpose of a customer relationship management platform is to help
          employees manage customer relationships. Employees in sales, support,
          marketing, and customer success frequently use it. To use this
          platform, every team member can access essential client information,
          add information (for example, contact information or notes about a
          recent interaction), upload files, build reports, or take action (for
          example, sending emails). On the other hand, ERPs are software
          programs that allow organizations to perform various day-to- day
          tasks, most of which are sure to finance. Any activities related to
          accounting, procurement, risk management, and supply chain management
          fall under this category.
