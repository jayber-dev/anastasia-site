          Data management tools such as CRM and ERP are essential for managing
          customer,<br />
          financial, and other business data. Approximately 90% of organizations
          with 11 or more employees use a CRM, which explains why the ERP market
          is expected to exceed $49.5 billion in just a few years. To make the
          most of both platforms and ensure that your most critical business
          processes function effectively, you must integrate them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of a customer relationship management platform is to help
          employees manage customer relationships. Employees in sales, support,
          marketing, and customer success frequently use it. To use this
          platform, every team member can access essential client information,
          add information (for example, contact information or notes about a
          recent interaction), upload files, build reports, or take action (for
          example, sending emails). On the other hand, ERPs are software
          programs that allow organizations to perform various day-to- day
          tasks, most of which are sure to finance. Any activities related to
          accounting, procurement, risk management, and supply chain management
          fall under this category.

        Many players in the market offer platforms that help you automate
        no-code workflows between your favorite apps and other services like
        synchronizing files, triggering notifications, collecting data, and
        more. My role was to conduct research to identify our competitors and
        figure out what we could do to create a better platform. What People Use
        Today : Zappier, Workato, Make, Power Automate by Microsoft, and more
        Conclusion Bringing ERP and CRM together removes data silos between
        sales and finance, allows employees to (more easily) avoid human errors
        and enables sales reps and accounts receivable specialists to focus on
        more strategic, business- critical tasks.

      <h1>Pain Points</h1>
      <p>
        Before we started to develop the new system with the Product manager, we
        tried to understand all the pain points of the Engini platform. 1.
        Platform was very complicated and twisty. 2. The design was unclear.
        Different font and size were used, and there was no matching pattern. 3.
        The software contained too much irrelevant information. 4. Users could
        create a Flow in a different direction that didn’t have any reasonable
        motive.
